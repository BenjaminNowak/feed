## Viewing the RSS feed

Once GitHub Pages is enabled, navigate to `https://<username>.github.io/<repository>/feed.xml` (replace `<username>` and `<repository>` with your values) to see the RSS output. The site includes a basic `index.html` page that links to the feed.

## Enabling GitHub Pages

1. Open the repository on GitHub and go to **Settings**.
2. Select **Pages** from the left sidebar.
3. Under **Build and deployment**, choose the branch (e.g., `main`) and the folder (usually `/root` or `/docs`).
4. Click **Save**. GitHub will provide a link to your published site in a few moments.
